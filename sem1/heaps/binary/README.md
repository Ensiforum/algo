# BINARY HEAP

The binary heap is a binary tree (a tree in which each node has at most two children) 
which satisfies the following additional properties:

The binary tree is complete, i.e. every level except the bottom-most level is 
completely filled and nodes of the bottom-most level are positioned as left as possible.
Max-heap property: The key of every node is larger than or equal to its children.

Notice that the binary tree does not enforce any ordering between the sibling nodes. 
Also notice that the completeness of the tree ensures that the height of the tree is ⌊log⁡n⌋,
where n is the number of elements in the heap.

A binary heap in which every node is smaller than or equal to their children is called a min-heap.
